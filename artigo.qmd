  This paper aims to present a systematic review of the literature on the 
  topic Value Investing and to measure in the literature whether the strategic 
  approaches followed in recent contributions linked to the pioneer authors 
  (Graham and Dodd, 1934; Fama and French, 1992) were able to identify returns 
  above the market average. Also identify and measure places where the studies 
  were done and main considerations and findings.\vspace{0.2cm} \linebreak

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Value investing is an investment strategy based on the fundamental 
analysis of companies, seeking assets that are traded below their intrinsic 
value. @graham1934security, were the 
first to propose this methodology, where "value" investors aim to identify 
stocks or other assets undervalued by the market, with potential for 
long-term appreciation. This strategy involves evaluating financial 
indicators, such as the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and 
other fundamental criteria.

Value investing assumes that the market is not always efficient and that 
there are investment opportunities in assets undervalued relative to their 
intrinsic value. If the market were completely efficient, it would be 
challenging to find undervalued assets since all relevant information would 
already be reflected in prices. However, proponents of value investing argue 
that the market is not perfectly efficient and that investors can identify 
investment opportunities through fundamental analysis. This perspective 
implies that asset prices may not fully reflect the available information 
or that investors may underestimate or overestimate an asset's value, 
allowing value investors to identify investment opportunities.

@jensen1967performance was the first author to analyze the performance of 
investment strategies implemented by portfolio managers, introducing the 
analysis known as Jensen's alpha. His analysis was based on the CAPM 
developed by @sharpe1964capital. However, CAPM was later heavily criticized by 
@fama1992cross and @fama1993common, and current research has argued that 
multifactor models can better explain the returns and excess returns 
of investment portfolios [@fama2015five].

In summary, value investing partially challenges the market efficiency 
hypothesis, suggesting that investors can achieve superior returns by 
identifying undervalued assets. In this article, a literature review is 
proposed to seek evidence in the literature identifying abnormal returns.



# Research Problem and Objectives {#sec-resprob}

The main objective of this article is to identify value investing 
methodologies developed by Benjamin Graham in the stock markets across 
different regions and to measure whether their results have been able 
to produce excess returns (positive Jensen’s alpha). In the authors' best 
understanding, multifactor asset pricing models allow for greater accuracy 
in specifying the return generation process of a value investing portfolio 
and in estimating associated parameters, compared to CAPM. Thus, based on 
the collected data, this study aims to determine whether the returns 
generated are justified by the risk taken, according to models accepted by 
academia.
